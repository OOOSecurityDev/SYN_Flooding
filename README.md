# SYN-Flooding
A [SYN Flood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SYN_flood) attack is a common form of [denial of service attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack) in which an attacker sends a sequence of SYN requests to the target system (can be a router, firewall, Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS),etc.) in order to consume its resources, preventing legitimate clients from establishing a regular connection.<br/><br/>
TCP SYN flood exploits the first part of the TCP three-way handshake, and since every connection using the TCP protocol requires it, this attack proves to be dangerous and can take down several network components.
